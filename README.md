# ALU Student Academic Platform

## Project Purpose

The ALU Student Academic Platform is a Flutter mobile application designed to help students manage **assignments, academic sessions, and attendance** in one centralized dashboard.
The goal is to improve organization, track academic progress, and provide timely reminders for upcoming responsibilities.

## Core Features

- **Dashboard**
  - Displays today’s date and academic week
  - Shows today’s sessions, upcoming assignments, attendance percentage, and pending tasks

- **Assignments Management**
  - Add, edit, delete, and mark assignments as completed
  - Track due dates and priority levels

- **Session Scheduling**
  - Create, update, and remove academic sessions

  - Automatic attendance percentage calculation
  - Alert when attendance drops below 75%

- **Navigation**
  - Bottom navigation between **Dashboard, Assignments, and Schedule** screens

## Project Architecture

The codebase follows a **modular Flutter structure**:

```
lib/
 ├── screens/     # Main UI screens (dashboard, assignments, schedule, auth)
 ├── widgets/     # Reusable UI components
 └── main.dart    # App entry point, theme, and routing
```

This separation ensures **clean code, reusability, and maintainability**.
